The design of this program involves an ICommand interface that has numerous class that implements it. Their purpose is to call the corresponding method in models and prints a corresponding message for each input. These commands will be given to a map in the main controller class (command pattern). The controller implements the IController interface that allows for future extensions to the program. 
The model implements the IModel interface. Again, this is meant for future extensions. This is the case for both portfolio and stock; they both have a corresponding interface. The information is obtained from either AlphaVantage or a pre-saved CSV file. These information is obtained via a IReader interface, where each class that implements it gets information differently.
